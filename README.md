Rescue The Princess Game

HI, Here's how to run Rescue the Princess:

  1. The code will start by asking the dimensions of the board which must be entered as 3 space seperated integers.
  2. Then it will go for coordinates of princess and mario, also need to be added as 3 space seperated integers.
  3. This is followed by numbers of monsters present on the board followed by entering their coordinates.

Here is an example:
